Welcome!

This website serves as a record for a project for COMP 523 at the University of North Carolina. More details on the course can be found at <a href="https://comp523.cs.unc.edu"> https://comp523.cs.unc.edu </a>. The ZIP Code Lookup Tool is a web app for researchers at the university to find the congressional dictricts for those filling out surveys based on a given ZIP code. We are planning to make the tool fully compatible with Qualtircs, a common survey software used in academic research.
