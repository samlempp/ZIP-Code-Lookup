Today we had our first meeting with our client. During it, we were able to dive deeper into the project we will be helping him to create. A tool to aid researchers utilizing surveys, he walked us through some of the techincal aspects of the project and gave us a better sense of the need behind it. Furthermore, we were all able to introduce ourselves and set up a schedule for meeting going forward in the semester.

Overall, it was a great first meeting and we are looking forward to our next one!
