<p>We had another successful meeting with our mentor today. We displayed our clickable prototype on Figma and discussed our choice of Django for the environment 
and the benefits of various database options. We also discussed authentification for the call to the web service that the survey softwate Qualtrics will make. 
We plan to start setting up the environment this week. We're also working on some design choices when it comes to
logos and colors for the UI. We decided rebrand the project to Pear after a recent meeting with our client, expanding to serve other researchers using Qualtrics
at UNC. Our client Tyler trains other researchers in this surveying software and wanted the tool to be able to handle other users and datasets aside from his
original ZIP code and congressional district data. This gave us further functionality and the necessity for a UI. 
We are hoping to have a working web service in the next week or to; this will be our first goal from the coding side. 
Overall, we are on track and optimistic with where the project is going.
