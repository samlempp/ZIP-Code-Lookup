<h2><a href="https://samlempp.github.io/ZIP-Code-Lookup/deliverables/coverage/backend/index.html">Django Backend Coverage Report</a></h2>

<p>For the backend, we currently are at 75% test coverage. We are using a lot of built-in Django features (i.e. user authentification), so it is not surprising that we already have strong coverage in our code. That being said, more tests need to be written for our original pieces of code to reach full coverage, as we do not have many written at the time being. For example, we have no tests written specifically for the dashboard app in our project- this will be our top priority for testing on the backend going forward. Much of the code does not require testing, as it was provided by Django and thus already has strong coverage and is known to work. Overall, most of our testing will deal with making sure the request system works and will occur predominantly on the front end in regards to making sure components render correctly.</p>
