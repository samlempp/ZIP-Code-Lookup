<p>
Our overall system is shown above, with all pieces deployed on Carolina Cloud Apps (RedHat OpenShift). 
The client will be given access to the OpenShift deployment through Carolina Cloud Apps.
This service deploys our system at no cost to the client and can be changed if we decide to deploy somewhere else for a more permnant solutiom.
The code is hosted on our closed source Github repository and the client has a license to modify it if they see fit.
  The live app is hosted at <a>http://pear-git-slempp.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/#</a> and the backend for Qualtrics at  <a>http://pear-backend-slempp.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/</a>.
As of right now, the necessary user stories are implemented by the app, with a reskin of the frontend and more access to modifying the databases on the site on the way.
The highest priority next steps are finishing the reskin of the front end and adding more features for customizing the databases to the site.
