<p> Over the course of this semester, our teamâ€™s excitement for the tool we are creating has only grown. Fueled by weekly meetings with our client, we have found a further appreciation for what he is trying to accomplish. When the semester began, we mainly viewed our tool in the context of our client, which help him use inputted zip codes to dynamically return voting districts to the survey users. He had told us of its larger use case, but our appreciation for that larger use case is what has really grown this semester. The main feature the client wanted was a deployed API endpoint that could be used to grab the data from the surveys, which we have completed. Now, we are working on improving the website of the tool and adding more features. This has allowed a level of creativity within the project that the whole team is thankful for. We are excited to continue to add to the project in these closing weeks of the semester. </p>
